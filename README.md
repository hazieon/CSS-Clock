# What makes you tick?

A CSS ticking clock!
A pair programming project from early on in my coding journey. 
We made this little app to practice CSS and transformations as a part of the School of Code bootcamp, week 2.

## Requirements

- We used setInterval
- The hand moves round the clock every second and should complete a full revolution in 60 seconds
- We adjusted the rotation of the hand using the transform property as demonstrated in `main.js`
